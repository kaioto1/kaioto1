## 👋 Welcome, I’m @kaioto1
I’m passionate about crafting aesthetically and functionally pleasing digital experiences.


### 📚 The reason for this GitHub profile:
This GitHub profile is like a big sandbox for reading and writing code, to make a lot of mistakes but also to enjoy the process of pulling, comitting and pushing code around, solving problems and creating more or less useful things. At the moment I am learning React & Next.JS to start building web applications.


### ⚡️Fun fact:
I like light mode over dark mode.


This README has been optimized for accessibility based on GitHub's blogpost "[Tips for Making your GitHub Profile Page Accessible](https://github.blog/2023-10-26-5-tips-for-making-your-github-profile-page-accessible)".
